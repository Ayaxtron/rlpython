# Introduction to Reinforcement Learning in Python

Course materials I have used for a 12 lecture course on Reinforcement Learning and Game Theory.

Using environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com)

Topics covered (as of early 2018):

- Markov Decision Processes.
- Dynamic Programming.
- Monte Carlo Learning. 
- Temporal Difference Learning (Q-Learning, Sarsa).
- Function approximation methods / Deep Q-Learning.
- Policy approximation via black-box optimization. 
- Actor-critic methods.
- Zero-sum games. Regret matching and fictitious play. 
 
Some great resources:
 
- David Silver lectures.
- The classical book from Sutton and Barto.
- Yandex Practical RL course.
 
 
You can find the easy to read PDF/epub version in Leanpub (https://leanpub.com/rlpython).
