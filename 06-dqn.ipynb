    "# Deep Q-Networks and Experience Replay\n",

    "Gradient methods are intuitively appealing: you just move a little bit in the downhill direction. They have a serious drawback, however: they are not sample-efficient. To see this, observe that we update our function approximation in the direction of the experience, and then throw the experience away.\tIt would make more sense to find the best fitting value function given the agent's experience. We would be better off if we process batches of this experience, instead of throwing it all away.\n",
    "\n",
    "An **experience** or **replay memory** $\\mathcal D$ is a collection of tuples $(s,a,r)$. We will train the agent chooses randomly a minibatch from $\\mathcal D$, to replay his experience and update $\\theta$. Why choosing randomly? This helps break correlations from the data. For example, if you spent the second half of your time in an episode doing something completely useless from the reward point of view, you would not learn much if you take, say, the last 10 moves in your batch. This idea was introduced in a [*Nature* paper in 2015](https://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v518/n7540/full/nature14236.html), and has really impacted much of the research in the last two years, at least in what concerns video game playing. The DQN algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Take action $a$ according to $\\epsilon$-greedy policy. \n",
    "* Store transition $s,a,r,s'$ in replay memory $\\mathcal D$\n",
    "* Choose a random sample from $\\mathcal D$ (minibatch).\n",
    "* Compute $Q$-learning target with old, fixed parameters $w^-$.\n",
    "* Choose the new parameter $w$ that minimizes the error\n",
